 Here you are a summery of waht I struggled with, what I learned, and what skills I need to practice further.
 


| __My Learning points__ | As a web developer I learned how to downsize projects to smaller parts and attach this small parts in order and the way of building up projects in a way I can track down the smallest commits and reverse it back if needed , without rolling back the whole master thread . so more productivity with more organized plan and less mess and less efforts .when we compare that model with the waterfall classic project life cycles in which every step is built on the previous one and rolling back in those type of projects is a big problem and that is not convenient with real life projects .
| __Skills to be practiced more__ | As a web developer I want to layout basic html classes and ids and tags to create a landing page for my website | write the header , showcase,newsletter,3 boxes area and footer| empty style.css |
| __Struggles__ | As a web developer I want to creat css classes and ids to give a style to my index file | Edit the html if needed | update style.css with all needed  |
