 Here you are a summery of waht I struggled with, what I learned, and what skills I need to practice further.

| __My Learning points__ | As a web developer I learned how to downsize projects to smaller parts and attach this small parts in order and the way of building up projects in a way I can track down the smallest commits and reverse it back if needed , without rolling back the whole master thread . so more productivity with more organized plan and less mess and less efforts .when we compare that model with the waterfall classic project life cycles in which every step is built on the previous one and rolling back in those type of projects is a big problem and that is not convenient with real life projects .
| __Skills to be practiced more__ | As a web developer I get more comfortable in using git commands form git bash terminal and the right sequence of pushing and pulling and branching .Also I learned how writing user stories ahead to organize my work in the project.
| __Struggles__ | There was no struggle , tools like github and git and atom were really smooth and easy to use and once you do the prep-work well ,going through homework is a smooth process . 

Thank you ...
